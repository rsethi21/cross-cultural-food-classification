GOAL: create a dynamic model; can't learn all labels, but can make a learner that can classify and predict meaningful food statistics with some basic support

1. Hierarchical deep learning models using transfer learning for disease detection and classification based on small number of medical images
	- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83503-7
	- HDL and TL to reduce number of images needed to train models


2. Zero-shot/Few-shot learning
	- https://towardsdatascience.com/zero-and-few-shot-learning-c08e145dc4ed
	- play around with idea of shots and ways in support sets
	- goal is perhaps to use support set/support label concept until enough minimum images built for overall model
